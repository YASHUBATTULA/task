<p><b>C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming Language, unlike C which is a procedural programming language. This is the most important feature of C++.
 It can create/destroy objects while programming. Also, It can create blueprints with which objects can be created.
 We have discussed the Object-Orient Programming Concepts in C++ in this article.

Concepts of Object-oriented programming Language:

Class
Objects
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Abstraction
Machine Independent
A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.

Let us understand this feature of C++ with the help of an example. 
Suppose you have written a piece of code which can run on Linux/Windows/Mac OSx which makes C++ Machine Independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot run on different operating systems.

Simple
It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has rich library support, and a variety of data-types. 
Also, the Auto Keyword of the C++ makes life easier.
The auto keyword
The idea of the auto was to form the C++ compiler deduce the data type while compiling instead of making you declare the data type every-freaking-time. 
Do keep in mind that you cannot declare something without an initializer.
There must be some way for the compiler to deduce your type.
